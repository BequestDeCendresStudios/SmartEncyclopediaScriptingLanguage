# This AI system described architectural cults, that lure arcade gamers with graphics, bringing up concerns about loss of privacy being an invisble cost with the addiction acting as an invisible hand or cult leader predating laptops and personal computers. An addiction existing prior to smart phones. With the shelf acting as a computer lab. It also seems to imply that a particular political influencer approached studying the "Barbot Scale" to study Dark Romance, and how such reading contributes to similar cult like environments to Polybius.
